        <h1>Dear Willy,</h1>
        <p> ðŸŒ¸âœ¨ Happy national bf day! I did this program for you cause you really are special to me.
          I enjoy spending my time with you and cherish the memories we have. Even though we are
          long distance I am gifting you this, although I know it is not much. Te amo mucho. I 
          adore your smile and the way you look at me. I enjoy laughing with you and cuddling
          with you. You are the best boyfriend in the whole universe. Te amo mucho. I hope I get 
          to see you very soon. ðŸŒ¸âœ¨ </p>
        <p>Always yours,</p>
        <p>Daisy ðŸ’Œ </p>
